    <h1>Best Vegan Pancakes</h1>
    <p>Original recipe crafted by <a href="https://www.hummusapien.com/fluffy-vegan-pancakes/#tasty-recipes-23110">Hummusapien</a></p>
    <h2>Recipe First!</h2>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Pancakes:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tbsp ground flax + 3 tbsp water</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups whole wheat pastry flour</li>
        <li>1 tbsp baking powder</li>
        <li>½ tsp cinnamon</li>
        <li>¼ tsp fine sea salt</li>
        <li>1 cup unsweetened vanilla almond milk + 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>2 tbsp avocado oil (or melted coconut oil)</li>
        <li>2 tbsp maple syrup</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Blueberry topping</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup frozen blueberries</li>
        <li>1 tbsp chia seeds</li>
        <li>1-2 tbsp maple syrup</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, stir together flax and water. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Add almond milk and apple cider vinegar to a liquid measuring cup. Set aside to curdle.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt.</li>
        <li>To the liquid mixture, add oil, maple syrup, vanilla, and flax egg, stirring to combine. Pour wet ingredients into dry, stirring gently to combine. Lumps are good! Do not over-mix.</li>
        <li>Heat a griddle or large pan over medium heat and coat with oil or spray (I use coconut oil). Once hot, add ⅓ cup of batter to skillet, repeating as needed. Cook for about 2-3 minutes per side and flip once bubbles start to form. Cook for 1-2 more minutes or until golden.</li>
        <li>To make blueberry topping, place blueberries in a small bowl and heat in microwave or on stovetop until hot. Pour back into bowl and stir in chia seeds and syrup. Set aside for 5 minutes to thicken before serving. Top pancakes with blueberry mixture and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>

    <p>These fluffy pancakes are delicious and are sure to please everyone! I appreciate that it is a relatively
        simple recipe, and though I'm not a practicing vegan, I believe everyone should have some go-to vegan recipes
        in their repertoire to share with those in your life who do.
