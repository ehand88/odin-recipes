    <p>This soup is so easy to make, and you only need one pot! Hooray for fewer dirty dishes! It is inexpensive too -
        most grocery stores sell rotisserie chicken for $5-10, and the rest of the canned ingredients can be found for
        about $5 as well, bringing the cost per serving to $2.50 - $4.00.

    <p>I recommend also picking up some corn tortillas (like the kind used for street tacos). Crisp up the tortillas
        with some oil of your choice in a cast-iron skillet over medium heat. You just need enough oil to cover the bottom
        of your skillet. Put the crispy corn disk on top of your soup bowl and use your spoon to break it into pieces and enjoy!
